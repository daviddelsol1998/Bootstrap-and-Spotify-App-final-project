# Overview

In this repository, I am exploring the Bootstrap framework by exploring different components and css classes to style the Bootstrap and recreate my original portfolio website. For this I am using HTML5 primarily and I am also using an external CSS style sheet, as well as an external JavaScript file provided by the Bootstrap 5 official documentations.

The website I am attempting to recreate is https://daviddelsol1998.github.io/ a personal portfolio assignment originally build to showcase some basic HTML/CSS/JS skills. The website is hosted using github pages, and it is written using all the previously mentioned technologies. The clone website in this repository is also hosted on github pages https://daviddelsol1998.github.io/Bootstrap/index.html however there is only HTML for the website content and JS for an interactive feautre, as the boostrap framework provides external css and javascript files with predefined behavior for looks and responsiveness.

My purpose with this repository is to learn how to use Bootstrap framework to quickly Boostrap and prototype the front end of simple websites, to allow myself to dedicate more time into learning back end services.

# Development Environment

I have used VS code as my code editor along with the GoLive extension to write and test the website. I have used the prettier extension to format the code to follow industry standards. I was running Mac OS on one device and ubuntu on another device, while writting this project to check how the website is looking on different platforms. The website was also tested on an android device. 

Git used for version control along with GitHub Desktop for ease of use. GitHub is used to store the project.

HTML5 is used to display the website content. Javascript is used to display a message on top of the website addressing recruiters to inform them whether or not I am looking for a job at this time, this also greets them differently whether it is a weekend or not.

No CSS or JavaScript is used to generate the website's looks or responsiveness as this is address using Bootstrap 5 with external CSS and JavaScript files which interact with my HTML through classes.

# Future Work

As future changes are implemented on the original website, I plan to replicate the website using Bootstrap, at this time there is a new feature in the orignal website:
- A simple to do app that uses JavaScript to create a list of to do items that then can be marked as done and cleared.

I plan on replicating this behavior and look in the future using Bootstrap.
