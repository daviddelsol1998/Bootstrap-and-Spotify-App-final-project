# Final Project Description:

This repository contains my final portfolio for WDD 330 in which I am exploring the two parts of my project.
1 - Rebuilding my original portfolio using bootstrap https://daviddelsol1998.github.io/ instead of traditional css.
2 - Creating an spotify app that pulls data from the spotify api app using vanilla js and my own personal client id and token. The application allows the user to select from different music genres and pulls the most popular playlist of the slected genre. Once the playlist is selected, different music tracks appear and by clicking into one of them the user can see the artist, the song name and the album cover on the side.

# Future Work

As future changes are implemented on the original website, I plan to replicate the website using Bootstrap, at this time there is a new feature in the orignal website:
- A simple to do app that uses JavaScript to create a list of to do items that then can be marked as done and cleared.

I plan on replicating this behavior and look in the future using Bootstrap.
